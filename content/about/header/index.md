# **Bio**
My research is focused on understanding how people value their world around them by asking about their preferences, and by looking at their behaviours and the choices they make. Inspired by the diverse landscapes of Western Australia, I want to ensure that peopleâ€™s values and preferences for natural resources are adequately included in land-use policy and planning. 

I am an environmental economist currently working as Research Fellow in a collaboration between the UWA Centre for Environmental Economics and Policy and the UWA Oceans Institute.

I have been awarded the UK Agricultural Economics Society Prize Essay for best article by an early-career researcher in 2018 and, after completing my PhD research in 2022, I have secured funding for post-doctoral research on the social licence to operate offshore renewable wind farms in Australia.
