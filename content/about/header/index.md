# **Bio**
Alaya Spencer-Cotton is an environmental economist currently working as Research Fellow in a collaboration between CEEP and UWA Oceans Institute. Alaya’s research is focused on understanding how people value their world around them by looking at their behaviours and the choices they make. Inspired by the diverse landscapes of Western Australia, she is interested in understanding how people’s values and preferences for natural resources can be adequately included in land-use policy and planning. 

Alaya’s research was awarded the UK Agricultural Economics Society Prize Essay for best article by an early-career researcher in 2018 and, after completing her PhD research in 2022, she has secured funding for post-doctoral research on the social licence to operate offshore renewable wind farms in Australia.
